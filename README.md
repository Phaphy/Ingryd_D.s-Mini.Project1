such as "bad," "not good," and "poor" in the text.
- Calculate the percentage of negative words by dividing the count of negative words 
by the total number  of words in the text. If the percentage of negative words  is 
above a certain threshold (e.g., 5%), mark the feedback as negative; otherwise, mark 
it as positive.
